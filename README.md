# Restaurant Market Analysis and Concept Development Using Yelp GraphQL API

## Project Overview

This project explores opportunities for launching a new restaurant in Seattle by analyzing detailed data from Yelp using the Yelp GraphQL API. The analysis aims to identify key market trends, gaps, and potential restaurant concepts based on customer preferences, restaurant types, and review patterns. This document summarizes the final insights and recommendations for a new restaurant concept in Seattle.

## Key Insights and Findings

### 1. **Diverse Cuisine Landscape**
   - Seattle’s restaurant market offers a wide variety of cuisines, reflecting the city’s diverse population.
   - Customers are open to exploring different food types, suggesting an opportunity for fusion and experimental dining concepts.

### 2. **Pizza Market Saturation**
   - There is a high number of pizza-serving restaurants in Seattle.
   - Although pizza is in high demand, market saturation means it’s important to differentiate your offering in this space. A unique twist or specialty could stand out.

### 3. **Multilingual Customer Base**
   - Reviews on Yelp are submitted in multiple languages, indicating a multicultural customer base.
   - Offering multilingual menus and ensuring staff can communicate in key languages (e.g., Spanish, Mandarin) could provide an edge in attracting diverse customers.

### 4. **Influence of Yelp Super-Users**
   - Yelp super-users (those with 100+ reviews) have significant influence on restaurant visibility and customer behavior.
   - Attracting this group through loyalty programs or targeted promotions can amplify a restaurant's presence and reputation.

### 5. **Fusion Restaurant Concept**
   - A fusion restaurant combining local Pacific Northwest ingredients (like seafood, wild mushrooms, and seasonal produce) with global influences (particularly Asian and Mediterranean flavors) would appeal to adventurous diners.
   - Such a concept taps into Seattle's growing demand for sustainability, creativity, and local sourcing.
   - Given the many single-cuisine restaurants in Seattle (e.g., pizza, sushi), a fusion approach could stand out and attract a diverse clientele.

### 6. **Restaurant Concept Recommendation**
   - **Concept Name:** *Pacific Fusion: A Modern Take on Local and Global Flavors*
   - **Tagline:** A bold fusion of Seattle’s freshest ingredients with global culinary influences.
   - This concept emphasizes a seasonal menu with a focus on sustainability, fresh Pacific Northwest seafood, and innovative global flavors. Ideal for adventurous food lovers seeking new dining experiences.

## Technical Approach

### Tools and Data Sources:
   - **Yelp GraphQL API:** Used to gather detailed restaurant data, including customer reviews, ratings, cuisine types, locations, and more.
   - **Analysis Tools:** Data analysis was performed using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib` to extract trends and patterns.
   - **Data Cleaning:** Yelp data was cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and irrelevant information.

### Methodology:
   1. **Data Extraction:** Leveraged the Yelp GraphQL API to pull data on restaurants in Seattle.
   2. **Data Processing:** Filtered and aggregated the data to analyze restaurant types, popular cuisines, review frequencies, and customer demographics.
   3. **Trend Analysis:** Identified key trends and gaps in the market, focusing on customer preferences and restaurant performance metrics.
   4. **Concept Development:** Based on the findings, proposed a fusion restaurant concept that leverages local and global culinary trends.
